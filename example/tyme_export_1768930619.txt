Top 9 suggestions:
============================================================

Suggestion 1: category_dummies
  Type: categorical | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by allowing the model to learn non-linear relationships between the category and other features.
  How: One-hot encoding of the category column. This will create new columns for each unique value in the category column.
============================================================

Suggestion 2: value_norm
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by scaling the feature to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model convergence and generalizability.
  How: Standardization of the value column. This will subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation for each row.
============================================================

Suggestion 3: value_log
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by reducing skewness and improving model convergence, especially for features with a large range of values.
  How: Log transformation of the value column. This will take the natural logarithm of each value in the column.
============================================================

Suggestion 4: category_binning
  Type: categorical | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by reducing dimensionality and improving model interpretability, especially when dealing with categorical features with many unique values.
  How: Binning of the category column. This will create new columns for each unique value in the category column, with a specified number of bins.
============================================================

Suggestion 5: id_bin
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by reducing dimensionality and improving model interpretability, especially when dealing with numerical features with a large range of values.
  How: Binning of the id column. This will create new columns for each specified number of bins, with a range of values for each bin.
============================================================

Suggestion 6: value_diff
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by capturing temporal relationships and improving model interpretability, especially when dealing with features that represent changes over time.
  How: Difference between consecutive values in the value column. This will create a new feature that captures changes over time.
============================================================

Suggestion 7: category_count
  Type: categorical | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by capturing the importance of each category and improving model interpretability, especially when dealing with categorical features with many unique values.
  How: Count of occurrences for each unique value in the category column. This will create a new feature that captures the frequency of each category.
============================================================

Suggestion 8: value_lag
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by capturing temporal relationships and improving model interpretability, especially when dealing with features that represent changes over time.
  How: Lagged value of the value column. This will create a new feature that captures the previous value in the sequence.
============================================================

Suggestion 9: value_exp
  Type: numeric | Risk: none
------------------------------------------------------------
  Why: This may help improve predictive performance by improving model convergence and generalizability, especially for features with a large range of values.
  How: Exponential transformation of the value column. This will take the exponential of each value in the column.
